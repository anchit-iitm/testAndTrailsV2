Of course. Based on your successful completion of the Feast assignment after all the troubleshooting, you have a fantastic story to tell in your video. Acing the "errors encountered" section is a great way to show your problem-solving skills.

Hereâ€™s a script and guide for what to say and show for each point in your video screencast.

### **Have you successfully completed the objective?**

You should select **Yes**. You have successfully built and used the feature store from end to end.

### **Video Screencast Script (Points to Explain)**

#### **1. Explaining the Problem Statement**
* **What to Show:** Start with your main project directory open in the Vertex AI Workbench JupyterLab.
* **What to Say:** "Hi, this is my demonstration for the Week 3 assignment. The main objective was to integrate a **feature store** into our machine learning pipeline using the **Feast** library. The goal is to move from reading raw data files directly to using a centralized system for managing features. This helps ensure consistency between training and inference and allows for point-in-time correct lookups to prevent data leakage."

#### **2. Explaining your approach to reach the objective**
* **What to Show:** Briefly navigate into your `iris_feature_repo` folder, showing the `data` and `iris_definitions.py` files.
* **What to Say:** "My approach was to build the entire pipeline within a **Vertex AI Workbench** instance. I started by initializing a Feast feature repository and using **SQLite** for the local online store. I then wrote a Python definition file to tell Feast about my data source, the `iris_id` entity, and all the feature views. After deploying the store, I loaded, or 'materialized', the data from my source file into the online store. Finally, I used a Jupyter Notebook to fetch features from the store to train a model and then to get online features for a real-time prediction."

#### **3. Explaining and demonstrating the configuration of cloud compute setup**
* **What to Show:** Briefly show the Vertex AI Workbench page in the GCP console, then switch back to your active JupyterLab tab.
* **What to Say:** "For my cloud setup, I used a single, powerful service: a **Vertex AI Workbench managed notebook**. This provides a pre-configured JupyterLab environment with a terminal and all the Python tools I needed. It's the ideal setup because my code, my data source, and my local SQLite feature store all live in the same place, which simplifies the process."

#### **4. Explaining Input files/data**
* **What to Show:** In JupyterLab, double-click on your `iris_data_adapted_for_feast.csv` (or the `.parquet` version) to open it in a viewer. Point your mouse to the key columns.
* **What to Say:** "The input for this project was the `iris_data_adapted_for_feast.csv` file. Unlike the standard Iris dataset, this one was specifically prepared for a feature store. It includes two crucial columns: `iris_id`, which acts as the unique entity key for each plant, and `event_timestamp`, which records when each feature measurement was taken. These are essential for Feast to work correctly."

#### **5. Explaining and demonstrating sequence of actions performed**
* **What to Show:** Open the Terminal in JupyterLab and use the `history` command or scroll up to show the commands you ran.
* **What to Say:** "The sequence of actions was very specific. First, I ran `feast init` to create the repository structure. Then, after defining my features, I ran `feast apply` which registered the definitions and created the SQLite database. The next critical step was `feast materialize`, which loaded the data from my source file into that database. Finally, I moved to a Jupyter Notebook to execute the Python code that connects to the store and runs the ML pipeline."

#### **6. Exhaustive explanation of scripts/code and its objective**
* **What to Show:** First, open `iris_definitions.py`. Then, open your final Jupyter Notebook.
* **What to Say:** "There are two main pieces of code. First, in `iris_definitions.py`, I defined the three core components of Feast: the `FileSource` which points to my data, the `Entity` which defines the `iris_id`, and the `FeatureView` which groups all the features together.
    Second, in my main Jupyter Notebook, I fetch data in two ways. For training, I use `get_historical_features` which does a point-in-time correct join to prevent data leakage. For inference, I use `get_online_features` to get the single latest value for a specific plant, which simulates a real-time prediction."

#### **7. Errors that you have encountered and how did you overcome them**
* **What to Show:** You can just talk over your working notebook. This is where you show your expertise.
* **What to Say:** "I encountered and solved several interesting technical challenges. Initially, Feast kept trying to read my CSV file as a Parquet file during `materialize`, even with the correct definitions. I solved this by proactively converting my data to Parquet myself. Then, I hit an `AttributeError` because the timestamp column was being read as a string. I fixed this by ensuring the correct data types were set during the Parquet conversion. Finally, during prediction, I got a `ValueError` from scikit-learn because the order of features wasn't guaranteed. I solved this by explicitly re-ordering the columns of my inference data to match the training data before making a prediction."

#### **8. Working demonstration of your pipeline in GCP Environment**
* **What to Show:** Go to your final Jupyter Notebook. If you have outputs, click **Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs**. Then, run each cell one by one.
* **What to Say:** "Here is the final working demonstration. First, I'll connect to the feature store. Now, I'm fetching the historical data for training... as you can see, we have a point-in-time correct DataFrame. Next, I'll train the scikit-learn model on this data. Now, I'll simulate a real-time request by getting online features for three specific iris plants. And finally, I'll use the trained model to make a prediction on this fresh data. Here are the results."

#### **9. Explaining output files/data**
* **What to Show:** In the file browser, point to the `data` directory inside `iris_feature_repo` to show the `online_store.db` and `registry.db` files. Then point to your `iris_model.joblib` file.
* **What to Say:** "The main outputs from the Feast process are these two database files: `registry.db`, which stores the feature definitions, and `online_store.db`, which is the SQLite database holding the materialized online features. The output of my machine learning script is the trained `iris_model.joblib` file and, of course, the final predictions printed in the notebook."

#### **10. Learnings from this Assignment**
* **What to Show:** Conclude on your final notebook with the prediction output.
* **What to Say:** "My main learning from this assignment was understanding the crucial role a feature store plays in production ML. It's the bridge between data engineering and data science. I learned how Feast enforces a clean separation of concerns and solves complex problems like ensuring consistency between training and serving data, and preventing data leakage with point-in-time correct joins. This assignment made the concepts of offline vs. online stores very practical and clear."
