### ## Your Video Recording "Game Plan"

Here is a step-by-step plan that covers all 10 of your points in a logical flow.

1.  **Introduction (Explaining the Problem & Approach)**
    * **Show:** Your main GitHub repository page, showing the `dev` and `main` branches.
    * **Say:** "This is my project for Week 4. The problem was to build a full CI/CD pipeline for our DVC project. My approach was to use a `dev` branch for changes and `main` as the production branch. I used GitHub Actions to automatically test any new code, pull data from DVC, run `pytest` tests, and use `cml` to post a report back to the pull request."

2.  **Code & Setup (Explaining Scripts, Config, & Input Files)**
    * **Show:** Your code editor (like VS Code or your Cloud Shell editor).
    * **Action:** Open and show these files one by one:
        * `train.py`: "This is the basic training script."
        * `test_data.py`: "This is my first pytest file. It validates the raw data from DVC to make sure it has the right columns and no nulls."
        * `test_model.py`: "This is my second pytest file. It loads the trained model from DVC and checks if its accuracy is over 90%."
        * `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: "This is the most important file. This GitHub Actions workflow defines all the steps: setting up Python and Node.js, installing dependencies, pulling from DVC, and finally, running the tests and posting the CML report."
    * **Show:** Your GitHub repo's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** page.
    * **Say:** "To configure the cloud setup, I created a `GCP_SA_KEY` secret. This contains the JSON key for a Google Cloud service account that has 'Storage Object Admin' permissions, allowing the action to pull from my DVC bucket."

3.  **Demonstration (Showing the Sequence of Actions & Working Pipeline)**
    * **Show:** Your terminal.
    * **Say:** "To show the sequence of actions, I won't re-run everything live, but here is my command history."
    * **Action:** Run the `history` command or just scroll up in your terminal. Point to the key commands you ran to set everything up: `dvc init`, `dvc remote add`, `git push`, `git checkout -b dev`, `git commit`, `git push origin dev`.
    * **Show:** Your GitHub **Pull Request** (PR) page.
    * **Say:** "After pushing to `dev`, I created this Pull Request to merge `dev` into `main`. This automatically triggered my CI pipeline."
    * **Action:** Click on the **"Checks"** tab or the **"Actions"** tab for the PR. Show the successful workflow. Click into it and briefly scroll through the successful steps: `Install dependencies`, `Pull DVC data`, `Run Pytest and Create CML Report`.
    * **Say:** "This is the working demonstration of my pipeline in the GCP environment. The action successfully authenticated to Google Cloud and ran `dvc pull`."

4.  **Results (Explaining Output Files)**
    * **Show:** Go back to the **"Conversation"** tab of your Pull Request.
    * **Action:** Scroll down to the comment posted by the `github-actions` bot. Point to it with your mouse.
    * **Say:** "The main output of this entire pipeline is this comment, which was posted automatically by CML. The temporary `report.txt` file was created on the runner, and CML formatted it into this 'Pytest Sanity Check' report right here in the PR. This shows my tests passed and the pipeline is successful."

5.  **Conclusion (Explaining Errors & Learnings)**
    * **Show:** Keep showing the successful CML comment.
    * **Say:** "This pipeline is working now, but I encountered several errors. My biggest challenge was a `cml: command not found` error. I fixed this by installing CML using `npm` instead of `pip` and using `npx cml` to run it. I also had to add a `permissions` block to my YAML file to give the action permission to write a comment."
    * **Say:** "My main learning from this assignment was how to tie everything together. I learned how to automate data validation, model testing, and reporting, which is exactly what a real MLOps team does. Using CML to get instant feedback in a pull request is a very powerful tool for collaboration."
